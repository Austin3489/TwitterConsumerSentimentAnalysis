# TwitterConsumerSentimentAnalysis
This project is trying to find mutual interests from a target audience that tweet positively about Disney, as Disney was trending at the time of performing the analysis (April 20222). Along with this, we are going to try to grab some historical sentimental ratings for Disney as well, telling us whether this is a good choice or not based off of the sentiment rating.Once we can confirm that the topic chosen historically has positive sentiment, the goal shifts to understanding what is being tweeted as positive or negative from these users. This information can be taken from their timelines of tweets that they made.

# Project Language and Dependencies 
This project was done in Python, visualized in Jupyter Notebook. The library used to retrieve the tweets is Tweepy, a Twitter API allows developers to access certain information about tweets. This project uses 2 classes from Tweepy, named api and user. The api class is used for tweet retrieval and user is used for user specific information. In order to get access to the Tweepy functions we must use a consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access token secret credentials. The keys used here have been reset and do not work currently but the visualizations from their usage are there. The information used for where to place the tweets were panda dataframes and csv files. Csv files were used in case Tweepy no longer let us retrieve live tweets.
